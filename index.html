                <h2>Black & White</h2>
                <p>Most early forms of motion pictures or film were black and white. Some color film processes, including hand coloring were experimented with, 
                    and in limited use, from the earliest days of motion pictures. The switch from most films being in black-and-white to most being in color was 
                    gradual, taking place from the 1930s to the 1960s. Even when most film studios had the capability to make color films, the technology's popularity 
                    was limited, as using the Technicolor process was expensive and cumbersome. For many years, it was not possible for films in color to render realistic 
                    hues, thus its use was restricted to historical films, musicals, and cartoons until the 1950s, while many directors preferred to use black-and-white 
                    stock. For the years 1940–1966, a separate Academy Award for Best Art Direction was given for black-and-white movies along with one for color; similarly, 
                    from 1939–1966 (excepting 1957), a separate Academy Award for Best Cinematography was given for both black-and-white and color movies.</p>

                    <p>Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh; stylised as django)[4] is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view (MVC) 
                        architectural pattern.[5][6] It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent organization established as a 
                        501(c)(3) non-profit.
                        Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" 
                        of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[7] Python is used throughout, even 
                        for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is 
                        generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p>
